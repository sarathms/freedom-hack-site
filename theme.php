    <p>
      The idea is to fork the internet. These are the various themes we believe will help us achieve that.
    </p>

    <p>
      1. <b>Communication app via mesh network</b><br>
      Networks do not allow two phones to talk to each other directly. We need a way to allow two phone users to talk to each other using community band channels via low overhead networks.  The communication channel should support end-to-end encryption and should be secure. This could be a WhatsApp/Telegram replacement.

      2. <b>Mobile app for citizen whistle-blowing</b><br>
      Discussed in detail <a href="https://discuss.fsmk.org/t/mobile-app-for-citizen-whistle-blowing-celebrating-aaron-swartz/156" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      3. <b>Features for federated social networks</b><br>
      Discussed in detail <a href="https://discuss.fsmk.org/t/federation-on-discourse/95" target="_blank">here</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      4. <b>Mobile app for Discourse</b><br>
      Discourse is web based and having a mobile app will improve adoption.
    </p>

    <p>
      5. <b>Improvements to Tor and its plugins</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      6. <b>Improvements to Diaspora / Kontalk / XMPP</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      7. <b>Improvements to Freedom Box</b>
    </p>

    <p id="statement"><b>Problem statement:</b><i> Help the rural people who are currently not connected
    			to the Internet by  providing them connectivity via ad-hoc networks</i> </p>

    <p><b>Description: </b>Connectivity needs to be provided in the form of ad hoc, distributed
    networks. Once connectivity is established, services that run on these
    networks need to be designed. These services must be benefetial to the
    poor/farmers/fishermen/etc.</p>

    <p>Your hack can be either the implementation of the ad hoc network itself
    or a service that runs on such networks. If designing a service, keep in
    mind that it should function with little/no access to the Internet. A
    localised economy must be created and used if applicable.</p>
